# E-mechanic APP
- **This website will help carowners to link with the nearby mechanics for their services**
- **The car owner will only have to input the location he/she is and it will have the list of all mecahincs available nearby**

****
- Mechanics will have to register and share some of their details and their prices
- car owner will have to sign in 
**** 


Note: I have commented out the stylings for the 'group-mechanics' class in 'fm.css'. Those should be the styling for the desktop version and default styling for the mobile version.
